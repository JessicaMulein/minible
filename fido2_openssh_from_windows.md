# Setting up FIDO2 authentication on Linux from Windows

## Computer Requirements
Windows Client: Windows 10 version 1903 or higher.  
Linux Server: OpenSSH v8.2 at least, Ubuntu 20.04 if using Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites - OpenSSH
Version 8.3+ of OpenSSH is required for FIDO2 authentication to work on Windows. Unfortunately Windows typically uses an older version.  As funny as it sounds, the simplest way to get the latest openSSH is to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">git for windows</a>.

## Prerequisites - OpenSSH SK WinHello
Download the latest **winhello.dll** from the <a href="https://github.com/tavrez/openssh-sk-winhello/releases">the OpenSSH SK WinHello project release page</a>.  
Copy it inside Git /usr/bin folder (C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin by default, or C:\Users\<<your_profile>>\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\usr\bin).  

## Creating your Credential
Launch **Git Bash**, then type ```ssh-keygen -w winhello.dll -t ecdsa-sk -f id_ecdsa_sk -O user=<<credential_identifier>>```. Approve the request on your device.  
In the same git Bash window, start the ssh agent by typing ```eval `ssh-agent -P /usr/bin/winhello.dll` ```  
Add the key to the agent by typing ```ssh-add -S /usr/bin/winhello.dll```  
For information, two files are created when creating your credential:  
> FIDO/U2F OpenSSH keys consist of two parts: a "key handle" part stored in the private key file on disk, and a per-device private key that is unique to each FIDO/U2F token and that cannot be exported from the token hardware. These are combined by the hardware at authentication time to derive the real key that is used to sign authentication challenges.

## Adding the public key to your server
**Only if you don't have any public keys setup on your server**, an easy way to send your public keys to your server is to type ```scp id_ecdsa_sk.pub <<your_user_name>>@<<your_server_hostname_or_ip>>:~/.ssh/authorized_keys``` on the same git Bash window.

## Login into your server with your Mini BLE
Create a ```config``` file inside .ssh by typing ```vi ~/.ssh/config```. In it, enter the following contents:
```
Host <<your_server_hostname_or_ip>>
        SecurityKeyProvider winhello.dll
        user <<your_username_here>>
        IdentityFile id_ecdsa_sk
```
then simply login into your server by typing ```ssh <<your_server_hostname_or_ip>>```

## Automatically starting ssh agent & adding key
In the bash, ```vi ~/.profile``` and add the following contents:
```
env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent -P /usr/bin/winhello.dll >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2= agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add -S /usr/bin/winhello.dll
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add -S /usr/bin/winhello.dll
fi

unset env
```


## A failed approach using Windows WSL2
**WSL does not support USB devices connection out of the box.** This is left here for reference in case this changes in the future.  
Please install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10</a> to be able to use the latest openssh. An alternative installation guide can be found <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-on-wsl-2-is-generally-available">here</a>.  
In case you get "Error: 0x1bc", follow https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5651#issuecomment-663879171  
If you don't want to use the Windows store to install Ubuntu, follow these steps:
- Download ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz on https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/focal/release/
- ```mkdir Ubuntu_2004```
- ```wsl --import Ubuntu-20.04 Ubuntu_2004 ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz```
- ```wsl --list``` (Ubuntu-20.04 appears in the list)
- ```wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04``` (logged root)
- ```adduser <my_name>```
- ```usermod -aG sudo <my_name>```
- ```exit```
- ```wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04 -u <my_name>``` (logged <my_name>)
- ```cd```

You can then create a Windows shortcut targeting C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C "wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04 -u <my_name>".
